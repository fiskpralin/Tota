#This new file will hopefully be better 					2012-04-03
#Less double work and correct naming of the parameters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A means: A machine with one crane
B means: A machine with two cranes
C means: Continuous head (Rickard och Julia)
D means: Continuous head with twig cracking and logging
E means: Conventional head which can accumulate trees
F means: Conventional head which can accumulate trees and twig crack and log
J means: Bundler module in front of the machine which can make bundles of the trees and log them
