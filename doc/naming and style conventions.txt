So.. just some info about style and naming conventions. Enjoy!

//Linus


- First a note from me, I haven't really followed Python's guidelines for this. For example I use too much Camelcase. The below info is not that well written, read some code and you'll understand the style.



Info:

-Classes are written with capital first letter. Camelcase may be used. e.g. "ExampleClass"
-A file containing a single class has the same name as the class, but with small first letter, "exampleClass.py"
-Functions are written with small first letter. E.g. "exampleFunction" or "example_function"
-Methods have the same rules as functions
-Variables never start with capital first letter.
-Variables intended to be "private", and not accessed from outside, begins with _, e.g. "_provVar"
-each class, function or method begins with a """ dsfsfds """ -comment, with """ on separate lines.
-always use "import" instead of "from", to avoid circular imports.
